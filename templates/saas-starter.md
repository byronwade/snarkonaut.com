# SaaS Starter Pro

## The "I Swear This Is The Last Side Project" Starter Kit

Look, we've all been there. You have a brilliant SaaS idea. You open your editor. You stare at an empty `create-next-app` folder. You realize you need to build auth. Again. For the 47th time. You die a little inside.

**Stop the cycle.** This template has everything already built, so you can actually work on the thing that makes your idea special (you know, the part you're excited about).

## What's Actually In Here

### Authentication (The Part You Hate)
- **Email/Password** - Yeah, we included the boring one
- **OAuth** - Google, GitHub, because nobody remembers passwords anyway
- **Magic Links** - For the users who definitely won't lose the email
- **User Profiles** - With avatar uploads (we even handled the file size validation)
- **Session Management** - Secure tokens, automatic refresh, the works

We've debugged all the weird edge cases. Like what happens when someone signs up with `robert'); DROP TABLE users;--` as their name. (It doesn't work, by the way.)

### Stripe Integration (Stop Reading Docs)
- **Subscription Billing** - Monthly, yearly, or "please don't cancel" mode
- **Usage-Based Billing** - For when you want to charge per API call like it's AWS
- **Webhooks** - All of them. Even the obscure ones you'll never use
- **Customer Portal** - Let users manage their own subscriptions (fewer support tickets!)
- **Invoice Generation** - Automatically emails invoices because apparently that's still a thing

**Pro tip:** We've already handled the "customer canceled 5 seconds after subscribing" webhook. You're welcome.

### Database Setup (Supabase Edition)
- **Schema** - Properly normalized (we went to database class, unlike some people)
- **Row Level Security** - Your data won't leak (hopefully)
- **Migrations** - Version controlled, like git but for your database
- **Real-time Subscriptions** - Watch your data change live (very cool at parties)

### The Dashboard Nobody Asked For (But Everyone Needs)
- **Analytics Charts** - Pretty graphs that go up and to the right (aspirationally)
- **User Management** - Ban users who leave 1-star reviews
- **Settings Page** - All the toggles and switches your heart desires
- **Team Management** - Invite your co-founders before they ghost you

### Email Templates (That Don't Look Like Spam)
- **Welcome Emails** - "Thanks for signing up! Here's literally everything you need to know"
- **Password Reset** - "You forgot your password? Shocking."
- **Payment Receipts** - "Thanks for the money! Here's a PDF to satisfy your accountant"
- **Subscription Alerts** - "Your card was declined. This is awkward."

All styled beautifully with Resend. No more `<table>` hell from 2003.

## Tech Stack (For The Nerds)

**Framework:** Next.js 15 App Router
- Because Pages Router is so 2022
- Server Components everywhere (except where they can't be)
- TypeScript on strict mode (we're not animals)

**Database:** Supabase
- PostgreSQL that doesn't make you cry
- Real-time subscriptions (impress your non-technical friends)
- Auth built in (one less thing to mess up)

**Payments:** Stripe
- The only payment processor that doesn't make you want to quit tech
- Webhooks that actually work
- Test mode that won't accidentally charge real cards

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Copy-paste components from shadcn
- Dark mode included (because it's not 2010)
- Responsive AF

## What You're Really Getting

### The Good Stuff
- ✅ Complete source code (even the embarrassing parts)
- ✅ Database schema with migrations
- ✅ All Stripe webhooks configured
- ✅ Email templates that don't suck
- ✅ Admin dashboard (feel powerful)
- ✅ Comprehensive docs (yes, we actually wrote them)

### The Honest Truth
- ❌ Not a magic money printer (still need users)
- ❌ Won't fix your imposter syndrome (try therapy?)
- ❌ Doesn't include business plan (that's on you, friend)
- ❌ May cause sudden productivity (side effects: launching stuff)

## Who This Is For

**Perfect if you:**
- Want to launch a SaaS this month, not next year
- Are tired of following outdated YouTube tutorials
- Have copy-pasted Stripe docs one too many times
- Know how to code but hate reinventing the wheel
- Would rather work on features than infrastructure

**Not for you if:**
- You enjoy suffering
- You think "real developers" build auth from scratch
- You have unlimited time and patience
- You love debugging OAuth flows at 2am
- You're totally fine starting from `create-next-app`

## The ROI Math

**Building this yourself:**
- Research: 20 hours
- Implementation: 60 hours
- Debugging: 40 hours (minimum)
- Crying: 5 hours
- **Total:** 125 hours × $100/hr = **$12,500**

**Buying this template:**
- Payment: 30 seconds
- Setup: 1 hour
- Deployment: 5 minutes
- **Total:** **$99**

Even if you value your time at minimum wage, this is a steal. (And let's be honest, you're worth more than that.)

## Support

Need help? We offer priority support for $50/month where we'll answer your questions within 24 hours instead of "when we feel like it."

Included with template: Community support (aka you post in GitHub Discussions and pray someone smarter than us answers).

## License

Single-use commercial license. Use it for one project. Make a million dollars. We'll pretend we're not jealous.

Want to use it for multiple projects? Buy multiple licenses. We know you have 47 unfinished side projects anyway.

## Real Talk

This template won't guarantee success. It won't make your idea good if it sucks. It won't find product-market fit for you.

But it WILL save you months of boring setup work so you can focus on the hard part: convincing people to pay you money.

**Click that buy button.** Your future self will thank you.
