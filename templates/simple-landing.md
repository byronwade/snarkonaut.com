# Simple Landing Page

## The "I Just Need Something That Works" Free Template

You have an idea. You need to validate it. You need a landing page. But you also need to eat this month. So here's a completely free template that doesn't look like garbage.

**No catch. No email required. No "free trial." Just take it.**

## What's In The Box (For Free)

### The Essentials
- **Hero Section** - Big headline, subheadline, CTA button (the formula that works)
- **Features Grid** - Show off what your thing does (3-6 features, perfect)
- **Pricing Section** - One, three, or fifty pricing tiers (you do you)
- **FAQ** - Answer the same questions before people ask them
- **Contact Form** - Collect leads without Typeform
- **Footer** - Links, social, legal stuff nobody reads

### The Tech (Still Good Despite Being Free)
- **Next.js 15** - Same framework the paid templates use
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for free? Unheard of!
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility classes go brrrr
- **Responsive** - Works on phones from this decade
- **Fast** - Sub-second page loads (seriously)

### What Makes It Not Suck
- Clean, modern design (not "modern" like Windows 8)
- Dark mode included (because it's free, not ugly)
- Mobile-first (because most traffic is mobile, sorry)
- SEO ready (meta tags, sitemap, the works)
- Form validation (client and server, we're thorough)

## Why It's Free

**Option A:** We're nice people who want to help indie hackers
**Option B:** It's marketing for our paid templates
**Option C:** We had it lying around anyway

**The truth:** All three. Mostly B.

## Perfect For

### Testing MVPs
- Validate your idea without spending money
- Launch in an afternoon
- Iterate based on feedback
- Look professional while being broke

### Quick Projects
- Event landing pages
- Newsletter signups
- Product waitlists
- "Coming soon" pages
- Portfolio sites (if you're a minimalist)

### Learning
- See how Next.js 15 works
- Study the code (it's open source)
- Copy-paste parts for your own project
- Learn by doing (the best way)

## What You Won't Get

Because it's free, here's what's NOT included:
- ❌ Authentication (use our SaaS template for that)
- ❌ Payments (also need the SaaS template)
- ❌ Database (just a landing page, relax)
- ❌ Dashboard (what would you even dashboard?)
- ❌ Priority support (it's free, manage expectations)

It's a landing page. One page. That's it. That's the point.

## The Upgrade Path

**Start here (free):**
- Test your idea
- Get feedback
- Collect emails
- Validate demand

**Then upgrade to paid template when:**
- You have paying customers
- You need auth + payments
- You're ready to scale
- You can afford $99

It's like crack. The first hit is free. Then you're hooked and buy the good stuff.

## How To Use It

### The 5-Minute Setup
1. Click "Deploy to Vercel" (it's a button, you can't miss it)
2. Connect GitHub (you have an account, right?)
3. Configure environment variables (there are like 2)
4. Deploy (Vercel does this automatically)
5. Done (seriously, that's it)

### Customization
Everything is in one file. Find/replace to customize:
- Change text (obviously)
- Swap colors (tailwind.config.ts)
- Add your logo (public/ folder)
- Update images (drag and drop)
- Modify sections (it's React, you know this)

**Time to fully customize:** 30 minutes if you're slow.

## The Comparison

**Other free templates:**
- Built with jQuery (it's 2025, why?)
- Not responsive (mobile is 70% of traffic)
- No TypeScript (good luck refactoring)
- Bootstrap styling (is this 2014?)
- Sketchy download sites (enjoy the malware)

**This template:**
- Modern stack (Next.js 15)
- Actually responsive
- TypeScript included
- Tailwind CSS (beautiful by default)
- Hosted on GitHub (no sketchy sites)

## License

**MIT License.** Do whatever you want:
- Use it commercially (make money)
- Modify it (make it yours)
- Use it for multiple projects (we're not tracking)
- No attribution required (but we'd appreciate it)
- Sell it to clients (we won't judge)

Seriously, we don't care. It's free.

## Support

It's free, so support is "best effort" (translation: GitHub Issues when we feel like it).

**Want faster help?** Buy our priority support for $50/month. Or just Google it. Stack Overflow exists.

## The Real Reason We Made This

Every paid template needs a free tier to convert freeloaders into customers. This is that free tier.

But we also remember being broke developers who couldn't afford $99 templates. So here's something actually useful for free.

**Pay it forward:** When you make money with this, buy the paid template. Or don't. We're not your mom.

## The Close

It's free. It works. It's modern. It deploys in 5 minutes.

**What are you waiting for?** Permission? You don't need it. Just click the deploy button.

Worst case: You delete it later.
Best case: You validate your idea, get users, and buy our paid templates.

**Either way, we win.** (Mostly emotionally. Our paid templates pay the bills.)
