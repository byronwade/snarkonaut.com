# Modern Blog Template

## For Developers Who Want To Blog But Refuse To Touch WordPress

You want a blog. You're a developer. WordPress is beneath you. Medium takes 30% of your revenue. Hashnode is fine but you want more control. Substack is for writers, not hackers.

**Welcome home.**

## What Makes This Different (Other Than Not Being WordPress)

### Write In MDX (Markdown × React)
```mdx
# My Post

Here's a normal paragraph.

<CustomComponent prop="value" />

More markdown here!
```

That's it. Write in markdown. Drop in React components when you need them. No WYSIWYG editor from 2008. No fighting with blocks. Just markdown and code.

### Built For Developers
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Code blocks that don't look like crap
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - Because you live in GitHub anyway
- **Component Embeds** - Add interactive demos, charts, whatever
- **TypeScript** - Auto-complete for your content (yes, really)

### SEO That Doesn't Require A Plugin
- **Meta Tags** - Automatic for every post
- **Sitemap** - Auto-generated (Google already knows)
- **RSS Feed** - For the 12 people still using RSS readers
- **Structured Data** - Rich snippets in search results
- **Performance** - Fast sites rank higher (Google said so)

You won't need Yoast. You won't need RankMath. You won't need any SEO plugins because **the code is the SEO**.

## Features You Didn't Know You Needed

### Content Management (Without A CMS)
- **File-Based** - Your posts are markdown files in Git
- **Version Control** - `git log` is your revision history
- **Preview Mode** - See drafts before publishing
- **Categories & Tags** - Organize without taxonomy hell
- **Table of Contents** - Auto-generated from headings
- **Reading Time** - "5 min read" (always a lie, nobody reads that fast)

### Newsletter (Because Email Still Works)
- **Email Signup** - Capture those precious emails
- **Resend Integration** - Send emails that don't go to spam
- **Subscriber Management** - See who actually reads your stuff
- **Automated Newsletters** - New post → automatic email (set it and forget it)

Build your audience while you sleep. Or while you're debugging. Same thing.

### Analytics (Know Your Numbers)
- **View Counter** - See which posts nobody reads
- **Popular Posts** - Showcase your bangers
- **Traffic Stats** - Feel good when numbers go up
- **Per-Author Analytics** - If you have multiple writers (overachiever)

### The Nice-To-Haves
- **Dark Mode** - Obviously (it's 2025)
- **Social Sharing** - One-click sharing to places people actually use
- **Comments** - Optional (we use Giscus, it's GitHub Discussions)
- **Search** - Find old posts (that you forgot you wrote)
- **Author Pages** - Multiple authors supported (start your media empire)

- React components when you need them

- Monetization: They take 30%
- Verdict: Only if you hate money

**This Template:**
- Plugins: 0 (it's code)
- Speed: Actually fast
- Hosting: Free (Vercel hobby plan)
- Updates: When you want
- Verdict: You're reading this, so...

**Or you can spend the weekend configuring WordPress.** Your move.
